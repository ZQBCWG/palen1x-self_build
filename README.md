------

This distro's purpose is to make [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) easier and more intuitive(with TUI) to use within a stripped down distribution. Each option in `palera1n_options` correlates to what can be found in palera1n documentation. I am not including flags that the user will most likely never need, for example, `-i`. Further documentation on [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) can be found [here](https://cdn.nickchan.lol/palera1n/artifacts/c-rewrite/palera1n.1.html).
